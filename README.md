# PyMazeSolver
Project Description:
PyMazeSolver: Terminal-Based Maze Solver Using BFS Algorithm

Overview:

PyMazeSolver is an engaging Python application that demonstrates the power of algorithmic problem-solving in a visually appealing terminal-based interface. Utilizing the breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm, this tool efficiently navigates through complex mazes to find a valid path from start to finish. The journey of the solver is animated in real-time within the terminal, providing an interactive and educational experience.

Key Features:

BFS Algorithm: Implements the breadth-first search algorithm, known for its effectiveness in finding the shortest path in a maze or graph.

Real-Time Visualization: Animates the pathfinding process in real-time using the curses library, enhancing user engagement.

Customizable Mazes: The maze layout can be easily modified within the code, allowing for a variety of challenges and experiments.

Terminal-Based Interface: Runs entirely in the terminal, demonstrating advanced command-line interface techniques in Python.

Color-Coded Output: Utilizes color coding to differentiate between the maze walls, the path, and the solver, making the output intuitive and visually striking.

Technologies Used:

Python: The core programming language.
Curses Library: A Python library used for creating text-based user interfaces, handling the real-time visualization of the maze-solving process.
Usage:

PyMazeSolver is executed in a terminal window. Users can witness the BFS algorithm in action as it navigates through the maze, highlighting the current path in red. The application showcases algorithmic efficiency and is a testament to Python's capabilities for educational and illustrative programming.
